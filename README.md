## This project is about Code Complexity Analysis and Refactoring.
## The code is not bugged but is complex for new developers to understand. Hence, the concept of Hotspots
## and cyclomatic complexity is used to see how much of the code can be refactored.
## The method used for this proect was reducing size complexity by creating seperate module file,
## and reducing Cyclomatic Complexity by reducing the nested loops and conditional statements.
